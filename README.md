## üíª Project
This project is a solution to the challenge **RocketNews** of Discover course by Rocketseat. It consists of a web page developed with HTML and CSS that functions as a newsletter subscription form and lead capture. The concepts of DOM and JavaScript were also used to trigger an alert when the form is submitted with an email or left empty. The purpose of this project was to put into practice the knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, DOM and responsive web design.
